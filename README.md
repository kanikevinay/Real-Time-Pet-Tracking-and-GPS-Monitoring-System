# Real-Time-Pet-Tracking-and-GPS-Monitoring-System
The goal of this project is to create a smart IoT-based system that allows pet owners to track their pets in real-time. Whether the pet is inside the house or outside, the system will send notifications to the owner if the pet crosses predefined boundaries and provide GPS-based tracking in case the pet gets lost.
